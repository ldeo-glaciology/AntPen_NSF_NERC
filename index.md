# NSFGEO-NERC: Investigating the Direct Influence of Meltwater on Antarctic Ice Sheet Dynamics

A simple site for hosting information about the project. The GitHub repository behind the site is [here](https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/AntPen_NSF_NERC/blob/main/index.md). 

## About the project
This project is jointly funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF). NSF hosts a page about the project [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2053169). It is inspired by a paper published by the UK members of the team, ([Tuckett et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12039-2)).

The current project team (in alphabetical order):
- Isabel Cordero, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Columbia University, USA
- Sarah Crowsley, British Antarctic Survey, UK
- Ben Davison, University of Sheffield, UK
- Jeremy Ely, University of Sheffield, UK
- Nick Frearson, (LDEO), Columbia University, USA
- Jonathan Kingslake, LDEO, Columbia University, USA
- Stephen Livingstone, University of Sheffield, UK
- Ali Rose, British Antarctic Survey, UK
- Andrew Sole, University of Sheffield, UK
- Rohi Muthyala, LDEO, Columbia University, USA
- Kate Winter, Northumbria University, UK

The project will fund three field seasons on Flask Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula, and continent wide remote sensing. 

The field plan includes:
- Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements of ice flow
- Automatic weather station (AWS) measurements of surface melt
- Measurements of near surface temperatures with a thermistor string
- Uncrewed aerial system (UAS) measurements of ice flow
- Ice-penetrating radar measurements of ice flow (ApRES)
- Passive seismic detection of subglacial water flow

The field team for the first season is Rohi, Kate, Ben, Ali and Sarah and they are scheduled to be in Antarctica between Nov 2024 and Jan 2025. 

## News 

### January 30th 2025 - getting started on data analysis

Very exciting! We are taking our first look at the data collected on Flask. 

Its a relatively short time series o data -- next year we hope to have nearly a full year of data like this -- but it looks really promising!

![ApRES data from Flask Glacier](code/apres/season_1/strain_rate.png)

This plot shows the vertical strain rates measured in between 100m and 500m depth at a site on the main trunk of Flask Glacier. The two curves show esimtates form two different sets of measurements using different settings. 

There is obviously a lot to explore here and this is just an initial plot, but we think this is looking pretty excting. 

More plots liek this can be found [here](https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/AntPen_NSF_NERC/blob/master/code/apres/season_1/) and there is a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/AntPen_NSF_NERC/blob/master/code/apres/season_1/season_1.ipynb) in that folder which loads this data and makes these plots:

### December 16th 2024 - Antarctic Outreach
We love working in Antarctica and want to share our knowledge and passion with as many people as possible. Kate has been working with local groups in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and speaking to students in Scotland and Wales – telling them all about our research, and how Antarctica is changing. They have been particularly excited about the Wingtra drone, and together we have been thinking about how we programme drones, and how we can use drones to conduct more research in Antarctica.

![Young children (including Kate’s son) loved learning about polar animals and our Wingtra drone.](pictures/outreach_in_UK/1000000936.jpg)

 ![building Kate a polar vehicle out of lego](pictures/outreach_in_UK/1000000918.jpg)
 
 We have also been working with the UK polar network who connect school students to people working in Antarctica. Each year, school groups across the world learn about Antarctica and the Antarctic Treaty which preserves Antarctica for peaceful and scientific use. Inspired by this research, they create flags for Antarctica, as it does not have a flag of it’s own. We were very impressed by all the flags we took to Antarctica! Some of the flags we took photos of came from students in Peru! If you’d like to learn more about the Antarctic Flags Project, take a look at this website: https://polarnetwork.org/education-and-outreach/antarctica-flags/

 One of our more unusual outreach activities that we took part in was a smell walk. Dr Kate McLean has been creating sensory maps all round the world (https://sensorymaps.com/) and was looking to add Antarctic walks to her new book. We were only to happy to help! We were surprised by just how many different smells we noted in Antarctica, when we first thought there were none (the air is really clean and fresh in Antarctica). At Rothera, the natural smells tended to come from the seals (pretty smelly) and when you are walking along the shoreline, you smell the sea, but through the salt rather than seaweed (as there isn’t really any on the shoreline). The non-natural smells come from the incredible baking when you walk past the Rothera kitchen, the smell of fresh laundry as you walk past the accommodation blocks and diesel powered machines which are building the new Discovery Building (https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/rothera/the-discovery-building/).

### December 7th 2024 
We couldn’t have asked for better weather. We had 8 days of back to back low-winds, and roaring sunshine towards the end of our first week. In fact, it often felt too hot. We were having to apply sunscreen about once an hour, and pulk pulling in the heat was tough! Ali made us all nose guards to stop our noses from burning! 

It was very interesting to watch the glacier change as the days went on. Melt pools developed, the ice around camp turned slushy and a river even formed along the shear margin of the glacier! These are the kind of summer melt events we’ve been observing in satellite data so it’s pretty cool to see the glacier responding in real time. We can’t wait to delve into our datasets to see how fast the ice is flowing, and the potential drivers of change very soon.

### December 4th 2024 - great weather and lots of science. 

 The winds were low so we managed to get the UAV out on day 2. After a little problem solving it was soon off on its way – taking photos along pre-determined flight paths, so that we can compare photos taken at different times to analyse change. What a relief to see the drone flying back after an hour flight! All very happy in camp today.

![Wingtra UAV flying over Flask Glacier](pictures/flask/from_kate/Wingtra.JPG)

We quickly got into the swing of working on the Flask Glacier. We set off in two parties most days, with Kate, Ben and a field guide setting up GNSS, ApRES and seismic stations, whilst Rohi flew the drone, or added instruments to the weather station. Getting to the GNSS rock site was an exciting adventure. We had to snowmobile to a safe site, before roping up and skiing over crevasses, pulling pulks of science kit we went. From the base of the mountain it was a steep scramble over very loose rock, and a hike up some bedrock to a super GNSS base station site. The views were terrific - when visibility allowed us to peak out onto the ice!

![GNSS rock site](pictures/flask/from_kate/GNSS_rock_site.JPG)
![GNSS base station](pictures/flask/from_kate/GNSS_base_station.JPG)
![ApRES](pictures/flask/from_kate/ApRES.JPG)

The Flask Glacier is heavily crevassed, so crevasse probing and crossing became quite an every-day occurrence, whilst getting to sites 2, 3 and 4. We counted 26 crevasses in the space of about 200 m. The best way to cross crevasses is by ski, to spread weight out over a larger area. It took us about 40 minutes to ski to the inland glacier sites. It’s quite a joy to ski in Antarctica because the scenery is just so beautiful!

### December 2nd 2024 - The first day on-ice science

Our first morning on the ice was super – we got all our science kit tied onto sleds and snowmobiled out to site 1. It’s a very picturesque 10 minute drive down the tributary we camp on, to the margin of Flask Glacier. Rohi and Ali quickly got to work setting up the automatic weather station, whilst Kate, Ben and Sarah installed the first GNSS unit. Everything was up and running in no time, thanks largely to Sarah’s fast kovacs ice drilling skills and Ali’s expert guy rope tying!

### December 1st 2024 - An update from the field!

The field team landed on a tributary of Flask Glacier on a rather cloudy day after looping around the Larsen Ice Shelf a few times to find a good break in the clouds to land. Once at camp, the team got to work unloading the planes with the help of the pilots and field guides. Many hands made light work and everyone was soon inside, enjoying a warm cup of tea in the science/communal tent.

The camp is super! Sarah and Ali, our BAS field guides, set it all up before we arrived. We have two sleeping tents, one toilet tent, one science/communal tent and one tent to house the generator and fragile science kit. They are all set up in a line to keep entrances out of the wind, and to ensure safety in the event of an emergency – like a fire. That’s why there’s a depot of food away from camp too. Just in case! It’s where out emergency stash of fresh cheese was kept too! We were well looked after by the chefs at Rothera who sent us out with a plethora of home-cooked meals and fresh food to liven up our standard ration boxes.

### November 27th 2024 - the science team are ready for the field!

The scientists on the team are all ready to go and will fly from Rothera to Flask in the next good weather window. All their science equipment is at Flask Glacier. 
There is a great sense of achievement, getting even this far! 
The team are poised to finally get on the ice and start making measurements!

The field guides and their pilot Dan have sent back some more incredible photos from Flask Glacier. Thank you to Pilot Dan for the photos!

The other members of the Flask field team (Rohi, Kate and Ben) have been practicing their cross-country skiing. Soon they will be out on Flask Glacier, pulling their science kit behind them on pulks. It's going to be quite a physically demanding field campaign.

![Cross country skiing practice](pictures/rothera/ski_trianing_BD.jpeg) 

Rohi got this incredible video over Rothera shoing the ship the Sir David Attenborough just to the south of the station.

The Wingtra UAV has been tested in Antarctica for the first time too:

![Wingtra UAV test flight](pictures/rothera/wingtra_testing.jpeg)

### November 22nd 2024 - the UAV arrives at Rothera Research Station
Isabel and Jonny breath a sign of relief as they received the news that the UAVs got to Antarctica safely!

![Wingtra UAV in boxes in the hangar at Rothera in fronnt of boxes of seismometers](pictures/rothera/boxes.jpeg)
![Wingtra UAV setup in the hangar at Rothera](pictures/rothera/wingtra_inside.jpeg)


### November 17th 2024 - training and equipment testing at Rothera Research Station

The team have been learning how to live and work in Antarctica. These are the stoves we'll use when we're camping at Flask Glacier to melt snow for drinking and to re-hydrate our evening meals.

![Stoves for melting snow and cooking](pictures/rothera/1000040967.jpg)


This is our first cargo load for Flask Glacier. Our two field guides Sarah and Ali are going to fly in and find the best place to camp and look for some safe routes for us to get to our science sites. This is all the equipment they need for 2 weeks of camping.

![First cargo load for Flask Glacier](pictures/rothera/1000040974.jpg)


We are enjoying base life. The food at Rothera is wonderful! This was our dinner on Saturday night - burritos and nachos. Yum! The chefs at Rothera are great.

![Dinner at Rothera](pictures/rothera/1000040974.jpg)

Rothera Research Station. There are many buildings here - including 3 accommodation blocks, a cafeteria and leisure block, a carpenter shed, a boat shed, a building hosting science offices, a doctors surgery, a makeshift barbers and an aircraft/boating control tower and a recycling centre (amongst many other smaller buildings and shipping containers). BAS are constructing a new building too - their bright blue multipurpose 'Discovery Building' which is shortened to the Disco building down here! It looks great! Lots of people are working on the build so Rothera has lots of construction workers and construction vehicles on site at the moment. It's very busy. There will soon be 160 people on station. All the beds will be full then. 

![Rothera Research Station](pictures/rothera/1000041110.jpg)

49 - We have spent most of the week unpacking boxes shipped by Isabel, Jonny and various other groups. Everything is exactly where we expected it to be thanks to Isabel's incredible organisation and packing lists. Here's a photo of Kate and Rohi setting up the weather station:

![Setting up the weather station](pictures/rothera/1000041149.jpg)

And finally, a team photo on the ice Adelaide Island:

### November 13th 2024 - field team makes it to Punta Arenas, Chile
The field team (Ben, Rohi, Kate) have made it to Punta Arenas in Chile, which is one of the main gateways to the Antarctic Peninsula. The journey from the UK to the British Antarctic Survey Rothera Research Station takes a couple of days, with 28 hours of flying time ![The field team in the hotel lobby in Punta Arenas](pictures/pa/PA_hotel_lobby.jpg)

The field team had quite the journey! [Here](https://youtu.be/tncRkcE_8HQ) is a Google Earth video showing their route:

### September 9th 2024 - Full team science meeting
Today we are at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, courtesy of a fellow Antarctic scientist, Rebecca Dell. This place is steeped in history and it is a privilege to work here and to follow in the footsteps of great Antarctic researchers that have gone before us. 

Each team member presented a different aspect of the project. Here's Andrew outlining his GNSS deployment strategy for all of us to discuss as a team.
![Each team member presented a different aspect of the project. Here's Andrew outlining his GNSS deployment strategy for all of us to discuss as a team.](pictures/cambridge-sep-24/1000036670.jpg)

We spent the day coming up with detailed science plans, including lots of contingency plans for bad weather, or for cases where we can't get to our ideal site because of meltwater or crevasses. The meeting was fueled by Ben's epic mint chocolate tiffin. Thanks Ben!

The whole FRAM team
![The whole FRAM team](pictures//cambridge-sep-24/PXL_20240909_144717347.MP.jpg)

We also met with Keith Nicholls, at BAS who gave us some incredibly useful guidance on using the radar system ApRES: 
![ApRES training at BAS with K. Nicholls](pictures/cambridge-sep-24/PXL_20240910_100259042.jpg)

### September 5th 2024 - Pre-deployment training
We've arrived in Cambridge for our British Antarctic Survey (BAS) pre-deployment training. It's our first time meeting as a team in person! The field team (Kate, Ben and Rohi) have lots of training to complete including: Working in Antarctica, Biosecurity, Health and Safety, Living at Rothera Research Station, BAS safety Culture and conflict management. We also need to complete remote-fieldwork specific training like crevasse rescue and roped glacier traversing.

Here's a few photos from our training: 
The field team - Ben, Kate and Rohi
![The field team - Ben, Kate and Rohi](pictures/cambridge-sep-24/1000036529.jpg)

Lectures about life and work in Antarctica
![Lectures about life and work in Antarctica](pictures/cambridge-sep-24/1000036512.jpg)

BAS provide all our polar clothing. We each have 18-20kg of clothing and accessories to carry south with us! This includes 3 pairs of gloves, 4 pairs of shoes, 2 sets of thermals, 2 hats, 2 jackets and the list goes on! We'll get even more when we reach Rothera! That's where they keep the big Mount Everest style down jackets and extreme polar hiking books. 

All Ben's clothing laid out on a table:
![All Ben's clothing laid out on a table](pictures/cambridge-sep-24/1000036526.jpg)

To rescue someone from a crevasse we need to learn how to stop them from falling any further (in the hope they can climb out themselves) but if they are injured then we need to set up a pulley system which will help us to pull them out of the crevasse safely.

One of our field guides, Sarah, showing us how to setup a 5:1 pulley system:
![One of our field guides, Sarah, showing us how to setup a 5:1 pulley system](pictures/cambridge-sep-24/1000036562.jpg)

There's about 120 people at pre-deployment training and that's not even everyone going to Antarctica this year! Not everyone here will be going to Rothera, some people will be staying on the Sir David Attenborough ship and others will be going to other stations like Halley Research Station, or stations on Bird Island, Sidney, South Georgia. 

In this photo there's about 5-10 field scientists, almost everyone else is there to support the science. We couldn't conduct our research without them!
![In this photo there's about 5-10 field scientists, almost everyone else is there to support the science. We couldn't conduct our research without them!](pictures/cambridge-sep-24/1000036685.jpg)


It's all getting quite real! We can't wait to go to Antarctica.

### Jun 13th 2024
Rohi is in Juneau, AK, testing out one of the Wingtra UAS. Everything is going well and she has sent back some incredible footage: 

![Wingtra UAS flying over a glacier](pictures/juneau/still-from-vid-1.png)

### Jun 11th 2024
Our first major shipment has successfully left Lamont! Nine individual items were palletized and shipped out this afternoon! This includes one of the Wingtra UAS, the ApRES units, a kovacs ice drill, laptops, tools. The shipment is due to arrive in Port Hueneme on Friday where it will continue its journey by ship to Punta Arenas, Chile.


### May-June 2024
#### Purchasing and packing!
Led my Rohi and Isabel, we have been frantically scoping equipment, getting quotes, signing up vendors to the Columbia system, purchasing equipment and eagerly unwrapping all science toys as they arrive. We've ordered all the components of the automatic weather station (including thermistor strings and an appropriately pre-programmed logger and customized logger enclosure), tools, zarge boxes, drills, pelican cases, laptops, SD cards, hard drives, stationary, chargers, batteries, and more. Thanks to Knut Christianson at The university of Washington, we also received four ApRES units back from Antarctica. Shipping delays meant that they arrived at LDEO roughly a week before they needed to be shipped south again, but we had time to test them and trouble shoot some issues. 

This photo does a pretty good job of showing the chaos that happens when your trying to unpack, test, and repack several different instruments in a small space

![Instruments and equipment spread out on a table](pictures/testing_packing/PXL_20240605_141206542.jpg)

We also purchased a new weather proof case for the Wingtra UAV:

![Wingtra UAV in its new case](pictures/testing_packing/PXL_20240605_153209664.MP.jpg)

### May 2024
We are very excited to welcome Ben Davison to the project as a postdoctoral researcher based at the University of Sheffield. Ben did his PhD at Sheffield and did a PhD at Leeds before coming back to the Sheffield for this project. Ben will take part in the first Antarctic field season in Nov-Dec 2024. This completes the science side of field team: Rohi, Ben and Kate Winter. They will be joined by a BAS field assistant on Flask Glacier. 

### Apr 1st 2024
We are very excited to welcome Dr Rohi Muthyala to the project as a postdoctoral researcher based at LDEO. Rohi did her PhD at Rutgers and has many years experience working on and around the Greenland Ice Sheet. Rohi will take part in the first Antarctic field season in Nov-Dec 2024. We are so pleased to have her on board!

### Feb 19th 2024
